To play the audio through the terminal using Node.js, you must have an audio player installed on your system, such as mplayer, afplay, mpg123, mpg321, play, omxplayer, aplay, cmdmp3, cvlc, powershell.

The audio files can be accessed in the folder path `${vscode-patn}/${raqim-ext}/media/sound` and are available in MP3 format.

## Features

### Prayer Reminder

### Audio Quran and Manaqib

The extension also includes a feature that allows users to listen to the Quran recitation and manaqib (Islamic poems) while working. Users can choose from a selection of reciters and poems and listen to them without having to leave their editor. The audio Quran recitation is by H. Muammar Zainal Asyikin from Indonesia, and the manaqib is from Syekh Abdul Qodir Al Jaelani Majlis Alkhidmah Surabaya.

### Prayer Times Schedule

The extension provides a schedule of prayer times for the current day (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isya). Users can see the exact time for each prayer and plan their work around it.
